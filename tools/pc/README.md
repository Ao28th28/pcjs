This directory contains the PCjs machine command-line utility [pc.js](pc.js), which allows you to start a "headless" machine with all TTY (eg, INT 0x10) output redirected to your console.

Load a JSON machine file, such as [ibm5150.json5](ibm5150.json5) or [compaq386.json5](compaq386.json5), with the utility's `load` command, either interactively or with the `--load` command-line argument.

For example, this command:

	pc.js --load=ibm5150

or, if your operating system doesn't automatically associate `.js` files with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en), this command:

	node pc.js --load=ibm5150

should produce the following output:

After the machine finishes booting (about 10 seconds), you should see the following output:

You can begin interacting with the machine OR you can press CTRL-A to enter the PCjs debugger.  For example, if you'd like to dump the machine's video buffer, press CTRL-A and type `D B000:0`:

To destroy the machine, type `quit` (or press CTRL-C) at the debugger prompt.

[pc.js](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs/tree/master/tools/pc) is more general-purpose than its predecessor, [pcx86.js](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs/tree/2ac6e5e62196212bede02f360634f04a9c358ed9/machines/pcx86/bin), and can theoretically load any other machine type listed in [machines.json](/machines/machines.json), but it has only been tested with `pcx86` and `pdp11` machines so far.

This utility is very much a "work in progress" and is intended for development work and testing only.  Also, since it is "headless", you will not see any output from the machine when running any software that writes directly to video memory.

### Support for XML Machine Files

Limited support for XML-based machines now exists; eg:

    pc.js --load=/machines/pcx86/ibm/5170/ega/1024kb/rev3/debugger/machine.xml

loads and runs the same [machine.xml](/machines/pcx86/ibm/5170/ega/1024kb/rev3/debugger/machine.xml) that also exists on the PCjs website.

Here's another example using a `pdp11` [machine.xml](/machines/dec/pdp11/1170/panel/debugger/machine.xml):

    pc.js --load=/machines/dec/pdp11/1170/panel/debugger/machine.xml

### Access Local Files from MS-DOS

If you run [pc.js](pc.js) with the name of a DOS executable; eg:

    pc.js pkunzip.exe

it will automatically build a 10Mb MS-DOS hard disk image in the `/tools/pc` folder with copies of all the files/folders in your current local directory, automatically start a [COMPAQ DeskPro 386](compaq386.json5) machine with that disk image mounted as drive C, and then run the specified DOS executable.

This allows you to run console-based DOS applications on your modern operating system (eg, macOS or Windows), with excellent IBM PC (or in this case, COMPAQ DeskPro 386) compatibility.  The experience comes with a number of caveats, and there are some important limitations to be aware of, such as limits on the size and number of files you can have in your current directory (the overall limit is currently 10Mb) and the fact that only console-based DOS applications are usable in this environment.

One of the pre-requisites of this feature is having a copy of the [pcjs-diskettes](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs-diskettes) repository in the `/disks/diskettes` folder of your PCjs repository:

    cd pcjs
    mkdir disks
    cd disks
    git clone https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs-diskettes.git diskettes

This is because [pc.js](pc.js) automatically copies system files from MS-DOS diskettes (eg, [MSDOS320-DISK1](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs-diskettes/blob/master/pcx86/sys/dos/microsoft/3.20/MSDOS320-DISK1.json)) to build a bootable hard disk image.

There are no plans to perform any kind of "dynamic" file system updates.  This means if you modify any files on your local file system, don't expect those modifications to show up inside the machine until you restart `pc.js`.  Similarly, don't expect any file modifications inside the machine to show up on your local file system until you terminate `pc.js` -- and only once that feature has actually been implemented (see below).

Coming soon:

- Options to select another machine type and/or DOS version
- Runtime options to load diskette images into drives A: and B:
- On machine termination, automatic detection of modified files and update of local file(s)

### Historical Notes

One early use of this utility was running a set of [80386 CPU Tests](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs/blob/master/software/pcx86/test/cpu/80386/test386.asm) as a custom ROM image inside an [80386 Test Machine](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs/blob/master/tools/pc/test386.json5), and then comparing the results to [output](/software/pcx86/test/cpu/80386/test386.txt) from real hardware.

The test program ([test386.asm](/software/pcx86/test/cpu/80386/test386.asm)) was carefully designed to be built as a binary (`test386.com`) that could either be run as a DOS program *or* loaded as a ROM image.  See [PCx86 CPU Tests](/software/pcx86/test/cpu/) for more information.
